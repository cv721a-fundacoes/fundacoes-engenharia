# Foundations Engineering — Civil Engineering (UNICAMP)

This repository gathers the **official instructional materials** for the Foundations course (CV721A)  
of the Civil Engineering undergraduate program at **UNICAMP**.

It contains **project statements**, **assessment rubrics**, **datasets**,  
**base notebooks**, and supporting materials related to the application of  
computational tools, always **subordinated to classical Geotechnical Engineering reasoning**.


## Objective of the Technological Track

The technological track of the course aims to **complement classical teaching**
of shallow and deep foundations by introducing, in an **incremental, controlled,
and critical manner**, contemporary tools commonly used in professional practice, such as:

- Machine Learning (ML)
- Building Information Modeling (BIM)
- Digital Twins
- Python and pyRevit scripting

> **Technology does not replace engineering.**  
> Classical calculations, technical standards, and professional judgment remain central.


## Repository Structure

- `docs/`  
  Official course documents (project statements, rubrics, schedule, and checklists).

- `datasets/`  
  Base datasets used in Machine Learning projects.

- `notebooks/`  
  Base notebooks provided to students as didactic support.

- `templates/`  
  Report and presentation templates.

- `examples/`  
  Simple, commented examples intended exclusively for educational purposes.


## Course Projects

### Project 1 — Shallow Foundations
- Mandatory classical design;
- Introductory application of Machine Learning;
- Basic BIM modeling;
- Critical comparison between methods.

### Project 2 — Deep Foundations
- Classical design and use of RSPile;
- Machine Learning at an intermediate level;
- Introduction to the Digital Twin concept;
- Integration of data, models, and assumptions.


## Student Use

- This repository is **for reference only**.
- Each group must create **its own repository**, following the guidelines provided in class.
- Programming complexity is **not evaluated**; emphasis is placed on:
  - organization,
  - clarity,
  - technical consistency.

## Course Coordination

- **Course instructor:** Prof. Dr. Paulo Albuquerque  
- **Technological track and computational support:**  
  Heloi Moacyr Tanoue (Teaching Assistant / Graduate Program)

## Important Note

The use of Machine Learning, BIM, and Digital Twins in this course is  
**didactic and exploratory in nature** and does not replace normative methodologies,  
professional responsibility, or engineering judgment.
