# CV721A — Foundations Course | Civil Engineering (UNICAMP)

This repository gathers the institutional materials for the Foundations course (CV721A), part of the Civil Engineering degree at UNICAMP.

It organizes project guidelines, assessment rubrics, datasets, base notebooks, and supporting materials for applying computational tools — all strictly subordinate to classical Geotechnical Engineering reasoning.

## Core Principle

Classical design methods, technical standards (e.g., NBR 6122), and professional judgment constitute the central axis of this course.

Computational tools are used as didactic and organizational support and do not hold decision-making authority in the design process.

---

## Technological Track Objectives

The technological track aims to complement the classical teaching of shallow and deep foundations by introducing contemporary professional tools in an incremental, controlled, and critical manner, such as:

- Machine Learning (ML) — for formative purposes  
- Building Information Modeling (BIM)  
- Use of pyRevit for parameter reading and verification  
- Basic Python programming for technical support  
- Introductory concepts of data and model integration  

> Technology does not replace engineering.  
> Classical design calculations and technical standards remain central.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/`  
  Official course documents (guidelines, rubrics, schedules, and checklists).

- `datasets/`  
  Base datasets used in Machine Learning activities.

- `notebooks/`  
  Base notebooks provided as didactic support (do not contain full solutions).

- `templates/`  
  Report and presentation templates.

- `examples/`  
  Simple, commented examples strictly for educational purposes.

---

## Document Governance

This repository constitutes the official technical repository of the course.

The `.tex` files available in `docs/tex/` are the official editable sources of institutional documents.

Updated PDF files are provided exclusively via Google Classroom, which serves as the official distribution channel for students.

This separation ensures:

- technical version control on GitHub;
- operational stability on Classroom;
- reduction of version conflicts.

## Course Projects

### Project 1 — Shallow Foundations

- Mandatory classical design;
- Introduction to Machine Learning via **Orange (low-code)** software;
- Introductory use of BIM supported by **pyRevit** for parameter organization and verification;
- Critical comparison between classical results and computational analyses.

ML at this stage is formative, not decision-making.

---

### Project 2 — Deep Foundations

- Classical design and use of RSPile;
- Basic Python programming for technical support;
- Expanded use of **pyRevit** for traceability between data, hypotheses, and the BIM model;
- Introductory-to-moderate ML application, emphasizing critical interpretation.

---

## Guidelines for Students

- This repository is for reference only.
- Each group must create its own repository, following the instructions provided in class.
- Assessment is not based on programming complexity, but on:
  - organization,
  - clarity,
  - technical consistency.

---

## Course Coordination

- Professor in Charge: Prof. Dr. Paulo Albuquerque  
- Technological Track & Computational Support:  
  Heloi Moacyr Tanoue and Samuel Santos de Souza Pinto (Graduate Teaching Assistants)

## Institutional Notice

The use of Machine Learning, BIM, and programming tools in this course is didactic and exploratory.  
It does not replace regulatory methodologies, technical responsibility, or professional judgment.
