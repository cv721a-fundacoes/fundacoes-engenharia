# CV721A — Foundations Course | Civil Engineering (UNICAMP)

This repository contains the official institutional materials for the Foundations course (CV721A), part of the Civil Engineering curriculum at UNICAMP.

Here you will find project guidelines, assessment rubrics, datasets, base notebooks, and supporting materials for the application of computational tools—all of which are explicitly subordinate to classical Geotechnical Engineering principles.

## Core Principle

Classical design methods, technical standards (e.g., NBR 6122), and professional judgment constitute the central axis of this course.

Computational tools are used solely for didactic and organizational support and do not hold decision-making authority in the design process.

---

## Technological Track Objectives

The technological track aims to complement the classical teaching of shallow and deep foundations by introducing contemporary professional tools in an incremental, controlled, and critical manner, such as:

- Machine Learning (ML) — Used for formative and literacy-oriented purposes.
- Building Information Modeling (BIM).
- pyRevit — For parameter reading, verification, and model-data traceability.
- Basic Python Programming — For technical support.
- Introductory notions of data and model integration.

> Technology does not replace engineering.  
> Classical calculations and technical standards remain central.

## Course Projects

### Project 1 — Shallow Foundations

- Mandatory classical design;
- Introduction to Machine Learning using Orange (low-code) software;
- Introductory use of BIM supported by pyRevit for parameter organization and verification;
- Critical comparison between classical results and computational analysis.

ML at this stage serves a literacy-oriented purpose and does not replace classical design decisions.

---

### Project 2 — Deep Foundations

- Classical design and use of RSPile;
- Basic Python programming for technical support;
- Expanded use of pyRevit for traceability between data, hypotheses, and the BIM model;
- Introductory-to-moderate ML application, emphasizing critical interpretation.

## Guidelines for Students

This repository is for reference only.

Each group must create their own repository, following the instructions provided in class.

Assessment is not based on programming complexity, but rather on:

- Organization,
- Clarity,
- Technical consistency.

## Course Coordination

Professor in Charge: Prof. Dr. Paulo Albuquerque

Technological Track & Computational Support:  
Heloi Moacyr Tanoue (PED / Graduate Program)

## Important Notice

The use of Machine Learning, BIM, and programming tools in this course is didactic and exploratory. It does not replace regulatory methodologies, professional responsibility, or engineering judgment.
